# Git Pull Script (with Conflict Helper)
# ==============================================================================
# This script safely pulls the latest changes from the remote repository.
# If a merge conflict occurs, it will attempt to open the conflicted files
# in Visual Studio Code to make resolving them easier.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Make sure you have the 'code' command available in your terminal.
#    (In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run
#    'Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH').
# 2. Run the script by typing: ./pull.sh
# ==============================================================================
