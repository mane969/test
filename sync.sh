# Git Sync Script
# ==============================================================================
# This script automates the process of resetting a local branch to match the
# remote version, which is useful after a team member has force-pushed to
# fix merge conflicts.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Save this file as "sync.sh" in the root of your project directory.
# 2. IMPORTANT: If your main branch is named "master", change the BRANCH_NAME
#    variable below from "main" to "master".
# 3. Open your terminal (like Git Bash on Windows) in the project directory.
# 4. Run the script by typing: ./sync.sh
# ==============================================================================

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# Change this to "master" if your primary branch is named master.
BRANCH_NAME="main"
